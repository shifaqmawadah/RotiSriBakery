      Roti Sri Bakery, founded in 2018, started as a small family business specializing in traditional breads and pastries. Over the years, it gained recognition for its delicious offerings and exceptional customer service. By 2019, the bakery expanded its menu to include custom cakes and actively participated in local events, boosting its popularity.

The challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 were met with adaptability, as the bakery introduced online ordering, delivery services, and innovative products like DIY baking kits. In 2021, Roti Sri Bakery diversified its offerings with healthier options and expanded its business by supplying local cafes and enhancing its storefront into a café-style space.

By 2022, the bakery focused on sustainability by using eco-friendly packaging and supporting local charities with unsold goods. Celebrating its 5th anniversary, it honored its roots with a "Heritage Menu." Today, Roti Sri Bakery continues to thrive, blending tradition with innovation while remaining a cherished part of the community.
